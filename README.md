# Employee Turnover Survival Analysis

This project was created as a final project for my undergraduate survival analysis course. In an attempt to look at survival analysis in more unique data types other than medical data which is typically used for teaching, my gorup chose to look at the factors which contribute to employee turnover rates. Using the Employee Turnover dataset on Kaggle provided by Davin Wijaya, our project determined the most important factors which contribute to an employee deciding to leave their company as well as the observed personality traits of those who left versus those who remained at their company.

This project combined survival analysis with data science methods, as we used PCA and hierarchcial clustering to analyze employee personality traits and determine if creatiivty, extraversion, independence, anxiety levels, and so on could be combined as an identifiable personality type. After determining 5 groups of personality combinations, we were able to predict how likely it is that an observed personality type would quit their job when faced with other external factors.
